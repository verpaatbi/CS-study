- **ChemDraw**: The world's leading chemical drawing and analysis software that enables scientists to quickly and effectively draw molecules and reactions, search databases, generate accurate names from structures, predict properties and spectra, and create publication-ready figures.
- **ChemDraw for Excel**: An add-in that adds chemical intelligence to Excel spreadsheets so that chemists can use Excel's analysis, sorting and organization tools to further manipulate and enrich sets of compounds and data and explore structure-activity relationships.
- **Chem3D**: A molecular modeling and visualization software that generates 3D models of compounds and allows chemists to view their structures in three dimensions, assess shape and properties, perform conformational analysis, calculate molecular mechanics and quantum chemical properties, and simulate NMR or IR spectra.
- **ChemFinder**: A chemical database management system that helps chemists to organize their own compound data in a searchable format, as well as access external databases of compounds and properties.
- **ChemScript**: A scripting language that exposes the underlying chemical structure processing power of ChemOffice to developers who want to manipulate structures and automate processes.
- **ChemOffice Cloud**: A cloud-based platform that provides access to ChemDraw functionality from any device with a web browser, as well as collaboration tools and chemical intelligence services such as name-to-structure conversion, structure-based search, property prediction, and more.

Chem Office 27 is available for Windows and Mac OS X platforms, and can be purchased as a standalone product or as part of a site subscription.

In this article, we will review some of the key features and benefits of Chem Office 27 and how it can help you in your research and teaching activities.
 
## ChemDraw: The Gold Standard for Chemical Drawing and Analysis
 
ChemDraw is the most widely used software for drawing and analyzing chemical structures and reactions. ChemDraw 27 offers several new and improved features that make it even more powerful and user-friendly. Some of these features are:

- **ChemDraw Cloud**: You can now access ChemDraw functionality from any device with a web browser, without installing any software. You can also save your ChemDraw files to the cloud and share them with your colleagues or students. ChemDraw Cloud also integrates with other ChemOffice Cloud services, such as name-to-structure conversion, structure-based search, property prediction, and more.
- **ChemDraw Direct**: You can now embed ChemDraw functionality into your own web applications using a simple JavaScript API. This allows you to create interactive web pages that let your users draw and edit chemical structures and reactions, as well as perform calculations and analyses.
- **ChemDraw Add-ins**: You can now extend the functionality of ChemDraw by installing add-ins that provide additional tools and features. For example, you can install the ChemDraw BioDraw add-in to draw biological structures such as peptides, nucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, and more. You can also install the ChemDraw Name-to-Structure add-in to convert chemical names to structures and vice versa.
- **ChemDraw Enhanced Stereochemistry**: You can now draw and display stereochemistry more accurately and easily in ChemDraw. You can use the new Stereochemistry toolbar to assign stereo centers, bonds, and wedges, as well as check for stereo errors and ambiguities. You can also use the new Enhanced Stereochemistry settings to control how stereochemistry is displayed and exported in different formats.
- **ChemDraw Enhanced Hotkeys**: You can now use more keyboard shortcuts to perform common tasks in ChemDraw, such as drawing bonds, rings, atoms, charges, brackets, arrows, and more. You can also customize the hotkeys to suit your preferences.

These are just some of the new and improved features of ChemDraw 27. To learn more about ChemDraw 27, visit [PerkinElmer's website](https://www.perkinelmer.com/product/chemdraw-professional-chemdrawpro) or watch this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqjYhGJ9Hhk).
