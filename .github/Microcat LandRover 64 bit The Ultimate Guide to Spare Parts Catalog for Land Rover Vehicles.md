Microcat LandRover is an electronic parts catalogue (EPC) that allows you to find and order parts for your Land Rover vehicles. It covers models such as Discovery, Range Rover, Defender, Evoque, Freelander and more. However, Microcat LandRover is a 32-bit application that runs on an obsolete 16-bit subsystem. This means that it cannot be installed or run on a 64-bit Windows system, such as Windows 7, 8 or 10.

Fortunately, there are some ways to overcome this limitation and run Microcat LandRover on a 64-bit Windows system. One of them is to use a virtual machine (VM) software that creates a 32-bit Windows environment within your 64-bit Windows system. In this article, we will show you how to use VMware Player, a free VM software, to run Microcat LandRover on a 64-bit Windows system.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Windows XP Mode
 
Windows XP Mode is a package offered by Microsoft that allows you to create a 32-bit Windows XP system within your 64-bit Windows system. It includes a 16-bit subsystem that can run Microcat LandRover and other 16-bit applications. You can download Windows XP Mode from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx). The file size is about 480 MB.

After downloading Windows XP Mode, proceed to install it by following the instructions on the screen. You will need to accept the license agreement and choose a location for the installation. The installation may take some time depending on your system speed.
 
## Step 2: Download and Install VMware Player
 
VMware Player is a free VM software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on your computer. You can download VMware Player from [here](http://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/desktop_downloads/vmware_player/3_0). You will need to register with VMware to be able to download it. The file size is about 100 MB.
 
After downloading VMware Player, proceed to install it by following the instructions on the screen. You will need to accept the license agreement and choose a location for the installation. You may also need to reboot your computer after the installation.
 
## Step 3: Import Windows XP Mode into VMware Player
 
Now that you have installed both Windows XP Mode and VMware Player, you need to import Windows XP Mode into VMware Player. This will create a virtual machine (VM) called Windows XP Mode that runs within your 64-bit Windows system.
 
To do this, open VMware Player and click on File > Import Windows XP Mode VM. You will see a window like this:
