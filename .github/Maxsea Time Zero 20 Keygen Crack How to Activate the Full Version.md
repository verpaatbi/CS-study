If you are wondering what other users think of Maxsea Time Zero 20, here are some reviews from different sources:

> "Great for navigation planning and visual position fixing, tidal data and weather presentation is a little disappointing â if you prefer Raster charts this is the app for you."[^1^]

> "I tested the TZ Navigator pack with advanced routeing and current charts for the UK and Ireland, which costs Â£859. This is a very comprehensive package that offers a lot of functionality and flexibility. The routeing module is particularly impressive, allowing you to compare different scenarios and optimise your route according to various criteria. The software also integrates well with Furuno NavNet 3D devices and instruments. The downside is that it is quite expensive and requires a powerful PC to run smoothly."[^2^]

> "I have been using MaxSea TimeZero for a few years now and I am very happy with it. It is fast, reliable and easy to use. The charts are clear and detailed, and the PhotoFusion feature is amazing. I also like the fact that I can connect my software to my Furuno radar and sounder via Ethernet. The weather and tidal data are also very useful. The only thing I would like to see improved is the weather forecast, which is not very accurate sometimes."[^3^]
