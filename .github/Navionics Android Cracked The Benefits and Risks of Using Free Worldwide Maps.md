Navionics is a popular app for boating and fishing enthusiasts, offering detailed marine charts and maps for over 2,000 lakes and coastal areas around the world. Navionics also provides features such as route planning, weather forecasts, tide and current information, sonar charts, community edits and more.
 
However, Navionics is not a free app. You need to buy a subscription to access the charts and maps, which can cost from $14.99 to $54.99 per year depending on the region and coverage you choose. If you want to save some money and get Navionics charts for free on your Android device, there is a way to do it by cracking the copy protection of the app.

## What You Need
 
To crack Navionics charts on Android, you will need the following:
 
- An empty micro SD card
- An Android phone with an SD card reader
- A computer with an SD card reader
- A software to clone SD cards (such as Win32 Disk Imager)
- A software to edit hexadecimal data (such as HxD)
- A copy of Navionics charts from someone who has a valid subscription (you can ask a friend or find one online)

## Step 1: Get the CID of the SD Card
 
The first step is to get the CID of the SD card that you will use to store the cracked Navionics charts. The CID is a unique identifier of the SD card that is used by Navionics to verify the subscription status of the user. You need to change the CID of your SD card to match the one of the original Navionics chart owner.
 
To get the CID of your SD card, follow these steps:

1. Put the empty SD card in your Android phone.
2. Download and install an app that can read the CID of the SD card, such as Micro SD CID Reader from the Google Play Store.
3. Open the app and write down the 32 hexadecimal characters (0-9, a-f) that appear on the screen. This is your SD card's CID.

## Step 2: Clone the Navionics Charts
 
The next step is to clone the Navionics charts from someone who has a valid subscription onto your SD card. You need to copy both the data and the partition table of the original SD card.
 
To clone the Navionics charts, follow these steps:

1. Put the original Navionics chart SD card in your computer's SD card reader.
2. Download and install a software that can clone SD cards, such as Win32 Disk Imager from SourceForge.
3. Open Win32 Disk Imager and select your SD card's drive letter from the Device drop-down menu.
4. Click on Read and choose a location and name for saving the image file of your SD card. For example, navionics.img.
5. Wait for Win32 Disk Imager to finish reading your SD card and creating an image file.
6. Eject your original Navionics chart SD card from your computer.
7. Put your empty SD card in your computer's SD card reader.
8. Open Win32 Disk Imager again and select your empty SD card's drive letter from the Device drop-down menu.
9. Click on Write and browse for the image file that you created in step 4. For example, navionics.img.
10. Wait for Win32 Disk Imager to finish writing the image file onto your empty SD card.
