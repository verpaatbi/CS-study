# What is Sikolohiyang Pilipino and How to Download Rogelia Pe Pua's Book
 
Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino psychology) is a branch of psychology that emerged from the Philippines in the 1960s. It aims to understand the Filipino people's behavior, values, and culture from their own perspective and language. It is based on the principle of "indigenization from within", which means that the theoretical framework and methodology are derived from the indigenous culture itself.

One of the pioneers and leading figures of Sikolohiyang Pilipino is Rogelia Pe Pua, a Filipino psychologist who is currently a faculty member at the University of New South Wales in Australia. She has written several books and articles on various topics related to Filipino psychology, such as identity, migration, racism, indigenous research methods, and social issues.
 
One of her most influential works is *Sikolohiyang Pilipino: Teorya, Metodo at Gamit* (Filipino Psychology: Theory, Method and Application), which was published in 1990. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the history, concepts, approaches, and applications of Sikolohiyang Pilipino. It also discusses the challenges and prospects of developing an indigenous psychology that is relevant to the Filipino context and experience.

Sikolohiyang Pilipino is based on the premise that psychology should be rooted in the culture and language of the people it studies. It rejects the notion that Western psychology is universal and superior, and that other cultures should adopt its theories and methods uncritically. Instead, it advocates for a psychology that is sensitive to the historical and socio-cultural realities of the Filipinos, and that uses their own concepts and categories to explain their behavior and worldview.

Some of the key concepts of Sikolohiyang Pilipino are *kapwa* (shared identity), *loob* (inner self), *hiya* (shame), *utang na loob* (debt of gratitude), *pakikisama* (getting along), *pakikipagkapwa* (relating to others), and *bahala na* (fatalism). These concepts reflect the Filipino values of interpersonal harmony, social obligation, reciprocity, solidarity, and spirituality. They also provide a framework for understanding the Filipino personality, behavior, and coping strategies.
 
Sikolohiyang Pilipino also has implications for various fields of practice and application, such as education, health, agriculture, art, mass media, religion, and social development. It offers insights and solutions that are appropriate and effective for the Filipino context and needs. For example, it promotes a holistic and integrative approach to health that considers the physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of well-being. It also advocates for a participatory and empowering approach to social development that involves the people as active agents of change.
