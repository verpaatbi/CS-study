The movie has a complex plot that switches between the present and the past. In the present, Kenny is a blind pianist who lives in London and works at a church. He is secretly an agent of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India's external intelligence agency. He is on a mission to kill the people who are responsible for a bomb blast that killed his wife Meenakshi, played by Anushka Shetty.
 
In the past, Kenny was Shiva Kumar, a brave and honest officer who was part of a covert operation to stop a terrorist group from acquiring a nuclear weapon. He was married to Meenakshi, a doctor who worked in a refugee camp. Their marriage was arranged by their parents, but they gradually fell in love with each other. However, their happiness was short-lived when a bomb blast at the camp killed Meenakshi and left Shiva Kumar blind.
 
Shiva Kumar was accused of being involved in the blast and was hunted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the British police. He escaped to London and changed his identity to Kenny. He learned echolocation from Daniel Kish, an American expert who is also blind. He used his skill to track down and kill the culprits behind the blast, one by one.
