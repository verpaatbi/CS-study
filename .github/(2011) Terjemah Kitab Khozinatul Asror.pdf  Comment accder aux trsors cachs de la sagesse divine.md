Sufism has a rich and diverse history that spans over 14 centuries and various regions of the Muslim world. Some of the most influential figures in Sufism include Hasan al-Basri (d. 728), who is regarded as the first Sufi and the founder of the Basrian school of asceticism; Rabia al-Adawiyya (d. 801), a female saint and mystic who emphasized the love of God as the highest goal; al-Hallaj (d. 922), a controversial martyr who claimed mystical union with God; al-Ghazali (d. 1111), a renowned theologian and jurist who integrated Sufism into mainstream Islamic thought; Rumi (d. 1273), a Persian poet and founder of the Mevlevi order of whirling dervishes; Ibn Arabi (d. 1240), a Spanish-born philosopher and mystic who developed the doctrine of wahdat al-wujud (the unity of being); and Abdul Qadir al-Jilani (d. 1166), an Iraqi saint and preacher who founded the Qadiri order.
  
Sufism is based on two key concepts: tawhid (the oneness of God) and ma'rifa (the experiential knowledge of God). Sufis believe that God is the only reality and that everything else is an illusion or a manifestation of His attributes. They also believe that God can be known directly through personal experience, not just through rational proofs or scriptural texts. To achieve this knowledge, Sufis follow a path (tariqa) that involves various stages (maqamat) and states (ahwal) of spiritual development. Along the way, they practice various disciplines such as dhikr (remembrance of God), muraqaba (meditation), sama (listening to music and poetry), and riyada (self-control).
  
Sufism has been a source of inspiration and creativity for many Muslims, especially in the fields of literature, art, music, and architecture. Sufi poetry, such as that of Rumi, Hafiz, Attar, and Jami, is widely read and appreciated for its beauty and wisdom. Sufi music, such as qawwali, sama, and gnawa, is popular for its devotional and ecstatic qualities. Sufi art, such as calligraphy, painting, and ceramics, reflects the mystical vision and symbolism of Sufism. Sufi architecture, such as mosques, shrines, tombs, and khanaqahs (lodges), expresses the spiritual values and aesthetics of Sufism.
