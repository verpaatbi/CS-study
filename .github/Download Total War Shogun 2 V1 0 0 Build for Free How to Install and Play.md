In this article, we will review some of the features and improvements that this version brings to the game, as well as some of the challenges and drawbacks that it may have. We will also compare it to some of the previous versions and expansions of the game, such as Fall of the Samurai and Rise of the Samurai.
 
## Features and Improvements
 
One of the main features of V1 0 0 Build is that it uses Unreal Engine 4, which is a powerful game engine developed by Epic Games. This means that the game has improved graphics, performance, and stability, as well as support for modding and cross-platform play. The game also has a new user interface that is more intuitive and user-friendly, as well as a new tutorial system that guides new players through the basics of the game.
 
Another feature of this version is that it includes all the previous updates and expansions of the game, such as Sengoku Jidai Unit Pack, The Hattori Clan Pack, The Ikko Ikki Clan Pack, Saints and Heroes Unit Pack, Otomo Clan Pack DLC, Dragon War Battle Pack, Rise of the Samurai Campaign, Blood Pack DLC, Fall of the Samurai DLC, and Fall of the Samurai Faction Packs. This means that players have access to a variety of content and options to customize their gameplay experience.
 
Some of the improvements that this version brings to the game are related to the balance and gameplay mechanics. For example, the game has tweaked some of the unit stats and abilities, such as increasing the accuracy and range of archers, reducing the cost and upkeep of cavalry, and adding more diversity and uniqueness to each clan's units. The game has also improved some of the AI behaviors and strategies, such as making them more aggressive and adaptive to different situations.
 
## Challenges and Drawbacks
 
However, V1 0 0 Build is not without its challenges and drawbacks. One of them is that it may not be compatible with some of the older mods and trainers that were made for previous versions of the game. This means that players may have to wait for modders and trainers to update their work or find alternative solutions. Another challenge is that some players may encounter bugs or glitches in the game, such as crashes, freezes, or errors. This may require players to update their drivers, verify their game files, or contact customer support.

Some players may also miss some of the features or mechanics that were removed or changed in this version, such as naval battles, siege battles, or diplomacy options.
