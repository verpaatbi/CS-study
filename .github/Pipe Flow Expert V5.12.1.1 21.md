# How to Use Pipe Flow Expert v5.12.1.1 21 to Design and Analyze Complex Piping Systems
  
Pipe Flow Expert is a powerful software tool that helps engineers, designers, and operators to design and analyze complex piping systems. Pipe Flow Expert can calculate the flow rate, pressure drop, and pump head requirements for any pipe network, as well as perform pipe sizing, valve sizing, and pump selection.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use Pipe Flow Expert v5.12.1.1 21, the latest version of the software, to design and analyze a piping system with multiple loops, branches, fittings, valves, pumps, and tanks. We will also demonstrate some of the new features and improvements that have been added to this version.

## Step 1: Create a New Project
  
To start a new project in Pipe Flow Expert v5.12.1.1 21, click on the File menu and select New Project. You will be prompted to enter a project name and a description. You can also choose the units system, the fluid type, and the calculation method for your project.
  
For this example, we will name our project "Example Piping System" and use the default settings for the units system (SI), the fluid type (water), and the calculation method (Darcy-Weisbach).
  
## Step 2: Draw the Piping System
  
To draw the piping system in Pipe Flow Expert v5.12.1.1 21, click on the Draw menu and select Draw Pipes. You can use the mouse or the keyboard to draw pipes on the drawing grid. You can also use the toolbar buttons or the right-click menu to add nodes, bends, tees, valves, pumps, tanks, and other components to your system.

## Step 3: Enter the Pipe Data
  
To enter the pipe data in Pipe Flow Expert v5.12.1.1 21, click on the Data menu and select Pipe Data. You can enter the pipe diameter, length, roughness, elevation change, minor loss coefficient, and heat transfer coefficient for each pipe in your system.
  
For this example, we will use the following pipe data:

| Pipe ID | Diameter (mm) | Length (m) | Roughness (mm) | Elevation Change (m) | Minor Loss Coefficient | Heat Transfer Coefficient (W/m^2 K) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Pipe 1 | 100 | 10 | 0.05 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

| Pipe 2 | 100 | 10 | 0.05 | -2 | 0 | 0 |

| Pipe 3 | 100 | 10 | 0.05 | -2 | 0 | 0 |

| Pipe 4 | 100 | 10 | 0.05 | -2 | 0 | 0 |

<!-- ... -->

| Pipe 20 | 50 | 5 | 0.05 | -1 | 0.5 | 0 |
